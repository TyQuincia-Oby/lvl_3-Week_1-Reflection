        <h2 class="text-center">Monday: Node.JS</h2>
            <p>On Monday, we made our first server with node.js. We learned a short history including that Ryan Dahl created it in 2009. Node.js is the backend (behind the scenes) server for JavaScript in Chrome, so it can run outside of the browser. The key features include: Event Driven Architecture (User interaction) and Asynchronous, or nonblocking (on and off feature) </p>
            <p> We also utilized npm (Node Package Manager) which are helper functions for node.js. Nodemon was also installed to ensure we did not have to keep restarting our live server. </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Tuesday: Modern JavaScript Syntax</h2>
            <ul><li>Arrow Functions: Provide concise syntax for writing Javascript Functions (call backs)</li>
            <li>Template Literals Aka Money Curly `${}`: allow for cleaner string interpolation without concatenation. </li>
            <li>Bracket Notation provides an alternative to Dot Notation for accessing object properties.</li>
            <li>Ternary Operators offer a compact alternative to if/else statements. For React, traditional if/else statements aren't allowed.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Wednesday-->
        <h2 class="text-center">Wednesday: Arrays and Loops (Code.org)</h2>
            <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can hold different data types including numbers, strings, and objects. Arrays have an index, meaning the first element is at index 0 (or the first position).</p>
            <p>We learned about how to restructure our lists with: </p>
            <ul><li>"\n" : this gives a list with a linebreak in our console </li>
            <li>"-" : puts dashes between two items in a list</li>
            <li>"join()" : this gives a list with a comma in our console </li>
            <li>"length" : this gives the number of items in an array. Adding "list.length-1" keeps us from going to far left or right when are clicking or navigating our lists. </li></ul>
